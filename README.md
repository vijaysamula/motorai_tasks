### Pre-Challenge Question-:
##### Give some advantages and disadvantages of RADAR over LiDAR:
1. RADAR has long-range compared to LiDAR.
2. It works at night and during the cloudy weather conditions.
3. It can calculate the velocity of the object.

### Post-Challenge Questions-:
##### 1. Do you feel that the projection of Lidar points on an image is necessary? If yes, How can it help in performing the scene understanding? If not also, explain Why?

Yes, because Image has higher resolution than lidar, classifying the image is more efficient because it has more features and utilizing the depth information from LiDAR. All these factors help in seeing the scene in 3D more effectively.
